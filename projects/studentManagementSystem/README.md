# Student Management System

A Java console application for managing student records, courses, and grades. This project focuses on implementing a robust system using Object-Oriented Programming principles and in-memory data management.

## Project Overview

### Core Features

- Student enrollment and management
- Course creation and management
- Grade recording and GPA calculation
- Academic report generation
- Student attendance tracking

### Learning Objectives

- Advanced OOP implementation
- Data structure usage (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap)
- File handling for data persistence
- Input validation
- Exception handling
- Memory management

### Data Storage

- All data will be stored in memory using appropriate Java collections
- Optional: Simple file-based storage using text/CSV files for persistence
- Note: Database integration is NOT part of this project scope
